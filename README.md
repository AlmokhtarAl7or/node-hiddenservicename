node-hiddenservicename
======================

A dumb Node.js app that sends the hostname used in the HTTP request. Then returns the .onion hostname when used as hidden service.

I know this is very simplistic. But I used it a few times to test apps, like [QtTorClient](https://github.com/AlmokhtarAl7or/QtTorClient) (an other very simplistic app :p )
